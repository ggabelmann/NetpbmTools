# NetpbmTools

A small CLI tool that can manipulate images.

My goal for 2018 was to learn a functional language so I picked F# after reading good things about it. But what to do with F#? After brainstorming I decided to write a tool that can work with the PPM (netpbm) file format. Some of the reasons are:

* The file format is simple.
* Image manipulation is naturally functional.
* I'm a photographer so I'm interested in using this tool.

The tool is still very much a work-in-progress because I'm both learning about F# and how to manipulate images!

## Future

My goals are:

* Develop the tool to the point that I can do a few useful things with it.
* Write it in idiomatic F#.
* Use F# as a stepping stone to learning Rust. :)
